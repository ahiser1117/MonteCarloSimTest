def t_test(x, y, equal_var=True):
    """
    Perform a two-sample t-test on the samples x and y.

    Parameters:
      x (array): 1D array of sample values from the first distribution.
      y (array): 1D array of sample values from the second distribution.
      equal_var (bool): If True, perform Student's t test (assumes equal variances).
                        If False, perform Welch's t test (does not assume equal variances).

    Returns:
      t_stat (float): The computed t-statistic.
      p_value (float): The two-tailed p-value.

    For the Student's t test (equal_var=True), the t statistic is given by
         t = (mean1 - mean2) / sqrt(pooled_variance*(1/n1 + 1/n2))
    with pooled variance computed as:
         pooled_var = (((n1 - 1)*var1 + (n2 - 1)*var2) / (n1 + n2 - 2))
    and degrees of freedom (df) equal to (n1 + n2 - 2).

    For Welch's t test (equal_var=False), the t statistic is computed as
         t = (mean1 - mean2) / sqrt(var1/n1 + var2/n2)
    with degrees of freedom approximated by the Welchâ€“Satterthwaite equation:
         df = (var1/n1 + var2/n2)^2 / [ (var1/n1)^2/(n1-1) + (var2/n2)^2/(n2-1) ]

    In both cases, the two-tailed p-value is computed via the regularized incomplete beta function:
         p = I_{df/(df+t_stat^2)}(df/2, 1/2)
